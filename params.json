Fortunately you can use muninlite (http://sourceforge.net/projects/muninlite/). Anyway muninlite doesn't support QNAP-Devices very well, so I made some tweaks. You can either use the patch file and get muninlite directly from SourceForge, or you can use the complete Script from this repository. The Script is based on muninlite 1.0.4 (with all plugins enabled) and was tested on a QNAP TS-419 Pro.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\n1. Copy the Script to ```/share/MD0_DATA/.qpkg/Optware/local/munin/```\r\n\r\n2. Install xinetd (```ipkg install xinetd```)\r\n\r\n3. Add the following line to ```/etc/services```:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmunin           4949/tcp        lrrd            # Munin\r\n```\r\n\r\n4\\. Add the following to ```/opt/etc/xinetd.conf```:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmunin   stream  tcp     nowait  root    /opt/local/munin/munin-node\r\n```\r\n\r\n5\\. Create ```/opt/etc/xinetd.d/munin```:\r\n\r\n```\r\nservice munin\r\n{\r\n        socket_type     = stream\r\n        protocol        = tcp\r\n        wait            = no\r\n        user            = admin\r\n        group           = administrators\r\n        #only_from       = 10.42.42.25\r\n        server          = /opt/local/munin/munin-node\r\n        disable         = no\r\n}\r\n```\r\n6\\. Restart xinetd (```killall xinetd && /opt/sbin/xinetd```)\r\n\r\n7\\. Configure a Munin-Machine to gather data from the QNAP-Device (as you would with any munin-node-Client).\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n===============\r\n\r\nUse the xinetd-Debugmode: ```/opt/sbin/xinetd -d```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
